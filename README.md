# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by displaying the sorting process step-by-step. The visualizer includes the following features:

### Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualize the following sorting algorithms:

  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Insertion Sort
  3. Selection Sort
  4. Merge Sort
  5. Quick Sort

### Interactive Controls:

  1. Shuffle Button: Randomize the array to be sorted.
  2. Start Button: Begin the sorting visualization.
  3. Speed & Array Size Slider: Adjust the speed of the visualization and the size of the array.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
  Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

  ttkbootstrap: A styling toolkit for Tkinter to provide a modern look and feel.

### Backend
Python: The main programming language used for implementing the sorting algorithms and handling the application logic.
